<p>he Mandelbrot set (/ˈmændəlbroʊt, -brɒt/)[1][2] is a two-dimensional set that is defined in the complex plane as the complex numbers
c
{\displaystyle c} for which the function
f
c
(
z
)
=
z
2
+
c
{\displaystyle f_{c}(z)=z^{2}+c} does not diverge to infinity when iterated starting at
z
=
0
{\displaystyle z=0}, i.e., for which the sequence
f
c
(
0
)
{\displaystyle f_{c}(0)},
f
c
(
f
c
(
0
)
)
{\displaystyle f_{c}(f_{c}(0))}, etc., remains bounded in absolute value.[3]

This set was first defined and drawn by Robert W. Brooks and Peter Matelski in 1978, as part of a study of Kleinian groups.[4] Afterwards, in 1980, Benoit Mandelbrot obtained high-quality visualizations of the set while working at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York.[5]


Zooming into the Mandelbrot set's so-called ‘Seahorse Valley’, with high iteration.
Images of the Mandelbrot set exhibit an infinitely complicated boundary that reveals progressively ever-finer recursive detail at increasing magnifications;[6][7] mathematically, the boundary of the Mandelbrot set is a fractal curve.[8] The "style" of this recursive detail depends on the region of the set boundary being examined.[9] Mandelbrot set images may be created by sampling the complex numbers and testing, for each sample point
c
{\displaystyle c}, whether the sequence
f
c
(
0
)
,
f
c
(
f
c
(
0
)
)
,
…
{\displaystyle f_{c}(0),f_{c}(f_{c}(0)),\dotsc } goes to infinity.[10][close paraphrasing] Treating the real and imaginary parts of
c
{\displaystyle c} as image coordinates on the complex plane, pixels may then be colored according to how soon the sequence

{\displaystyle |f_{c}(0)|,|f_{c}(f_{c}(0))|,\dotsc } crosses an arbitrarily chosen threshold (the threshold must be at least 2, as −2 is the complex number with the largest magnitude within the set, but otherwise the threshold is arbitrary).[10][close paraphrasing] If
c
{\displaystyle c} is held constant and the initial value of
z
{\displaystyle z} is varied instead, the corresponding Julia set for the point
c
{\displaystyle c} is obtained.[11]
